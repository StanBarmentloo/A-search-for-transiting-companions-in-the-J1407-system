Abstract:
  In 2007, the young star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen) underwent a
  complex series of deep eclipses over 56 days. This was attributed to the
  transit of a ring system filling a large fraction of the Hill sphere of an
  unseen substellar companion. Subsequent photometric monitoring has not found
  any other deep transits from this candidate ring system, but if there are more
  substellar companions and if they are coplanar with the potential ring system,
  there is a chance that they will transit the star as well.

  This young star is active, and the light curves show a 5% modulation in
  amplitude with a dominant rotation period of 3.2 days due to starspots
  rotating into and out of view. We model and remove the rotational modulation
  of the J1407 light curve and search for additional transit signatures of
  substellar companions orbiting around J1407.

  We combine the photometry of J1407 from several observatories, spanning a
  19 year baseline.  We remove the rotational modulation by modeling the
  variability as a periodic signal, whose periodicity changes slowly with time
  over several years due to the activity cycle of the star.

  A transit least squares (TLS) analysis is used to search for any
  periodic transiting signals within the cleaned light curve. We identify an
  activity cycle of J1407 with a period of 5.4yr. A TLS search does not find
  any plausible periodic eclipses in the light curve, from 1.2% amplitude at
  5 days up to 1.9% at 20 days. This sensitivity is confirmed by injecting
  artificial transits into the light curve and determining the recovery
  fraction as a function of transit depth and orbital period. J1407 is
  confirmed as a young active star with an activity cycle consistent with
  a rapidly rotating solar mass star.

   With the rotational modulation removed, the TLS analysis reaches down to
   planetary mass radii for young exoplanets, ruling out transiting companions
   with radii larger than about 1 Jupiter.

Description:
  Photometry from five ground-based telescopes of the star V1400 Cen with a
  model for the periodic modulation due to star spots removed. This data was
  used to search for transiting exoplanets and to characterise a multi-year
  variation in the rotational modulation, attributed to the activity cycle of
  the star.

# J1407_transit_search_activity
Repository for the code used to create the figures in the paper 'A search for transiting companions in the J1407 system'.

Timeseries data for the six telescopes considered in the paper is stored in the 'Data' directory. 

The 'Figure_x' directories are self consistent (together with the data from 'Data') and reproduce each figure from the paper via Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.
